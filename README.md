# SnakeGame

I finshed this game on 8/23/2022 and I made this game for fun. 
This game is made entirely from java and I used OOP to create the game.

## SnakeGame.java
This file just holds GamePanel in the main function

## GameFrame.java
This files creates the UI of the game and creates the window for the game

## GamePanel.java
This file is the entire game and all logic, input/output is in this file to allow the game to function.
